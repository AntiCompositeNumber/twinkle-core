# twinkle-core

This is intended to be the "core" repository for Twinkle using which Twinkle installations for different wikis can be created.

The twinkle-starter repository (yet to be created) will provide a template using which a new Twinkle installation can be started off easily. Each twinkle installation relies on twinkle-core as an npm dependency.

Documentation for twinkle-core is hosted on Toolforge. Check it out at https://tools-static.wmflabs.org/twinkle/core-docs ([alternative link](https://twinkle.toolforge.org/core-docs)).

As is the custom with TypeScript libraries, the GitHub repo only contains the TS  source files, and the NPM package only contains the built JS and .d.ts files.

## Contributing
- Set up an IDE or code editor configuration to work with JS/TS. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code or one of the JetBrains IDEs if you have a licence (JetBrains offers free licenses to [MediaWiki contributors](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/JetBrains_IDEs) and [students](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)). 
- See [the integrated development workflow](https://github.com/wikimedia/wvui#integrated-development-workflow) to work on twinkle-core while developing or testing a localised twinkle installation. The linked resource is from another repo â€“ replace "WVUI" with "twinkle-core".
